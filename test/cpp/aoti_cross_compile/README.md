Step 1: Run export_from_wsl.sh in WSL. The script will run export and AOTInductor to generate a model.pt2 file which contains a C++ project. After that, it will unzip model.pt2 and delete that model.pt2 file because the next Windows compilation step will generate a new Windows-compatible model.pt2 file.

Step 2: Run compile_on_windows.bat in Windows command line. It will compile the C++ project generated by the previous step, and pack the compile artifact back into a new model.pt2 file.

Step 3: Run `python run_optimized.py` in Windows command line, which calls `torch._inductor.aoti_load_package("model.pt2")` to load the model.pt2 generated by Step 2 and then run its forward function.
